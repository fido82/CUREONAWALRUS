This is Adam touching base with a little information regarding the recent o=
utbreak of the Coronavirus & my thoughts about it. As of the time of writin=
g this update there still appears to be a mortality rate of roughly 2% (tho=
ugh this varies greatly depending upon where one sources their information)=
. Let is also be known that much of what is written below is sourced
directly from Jim Humble's latest newsletter...

Coronaviruses are types of viruses that typically affect the respiratory tr=
act of mammals, including humans. They are associated with the common cold,=
 pneumonia, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and can also affec=
t the gut.

Signs of the virus are fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as c=
oughing, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath=E2=80=94however, it ha=
s been reported that some carriers of this strain of Coronavirus show no re=
spiratory symptoms at all. This makes it extremely difficult to detect carr=
iers of the virus, taking into account that health officials are looking fo=
r respiratory symptoms such as coughing, sneezing
and breathing difficulties. Another report said some carriers have no fever=
 and no coughing, but instead are exhibiting symptoms of diarrhoea, vomitin=
g and chest pains.

The purpose of this newsletter is not to analyse or speculate what is behin=
d all of this, or try to project where it is all going. As most would agree=
, we live in very unique times=E2=80=94whether you believe this and other s=
imilar outbreaks are part of a great conspiracy, or signs of the times acco=
rding to Biblical predictions, or whatever other reason=E2=80=94I would lik=
e to say,
it=E2=80=99s a good time to have some MMS on hand and educate yourself in i=
ts use.

There is much anecdotal evidence that says MMS has proven very effective in=
 eradicating viruses including Ebola, Swine Flu, TB, and other respiratory =
diseases. Chlorine dioxide was completely effective against Anthrax in 2001=
, and used by US Military for Ebola in 2014. It's been proven by the Red Cr=
oss in 2012 to eradicate malaria in just four hours, to name a few.

& to quote Jim Humble in his recent newsletter from the Genesis Church "I h=
ave reason to believe, MMS (chlorine dioxide), could be very effective in b=
oth preventing and eradicating the Coronavirus. With the barrage of health =
issues in the world today, I would say, let MMS be your first line of
defence. Why not be prepared for whatever may come your way? It's better to=
 have it and not need it than to need it and not have it."

The best way in which to use the MMS when dealing with viral issues is to c=
ount out 6 drops of MMS (activate with an equal number of drops wit the act=
ivator), allow to activate for a good 10 seconds or so, & then add 1/2 a gl=
ass of water (4 ounces / 120 ml), then immediately consume. Wait one hour, =
& then repeat.

What to do next depends upon how those first two doses made you feel. Follo=
w these next directions carefully:

Step 1. If you feel better after taking the two 6-drop doses of MMS, reduce=
 your intake to 3 activated drops in 1/2 cup of water every hour for eight =
hours a day, until completely well. You may want to continue this for up to=
 21 days to be sure you are free of disease and as an overall detoxificatio=
n of the body. Always take the MMS within seconds of mixing up the dose. An=
y time you should feel worse when taking MMS, proceed with Step 2
below.

Step 2. Any time after taking MMS activated drops you feel worse, cut your =
intake by one half but do not stop hourly doses. If you still feel worse cu=
t your intake by one half again, but continue with hourly doses. Feeling wo=
rse after taking the MMS drops such as showing signs of nausea, diarrhoea o=
r headache is actually a sign that you are ridding your body of toxins. It =
is called a Herxheimer reaction. It indicates you are killing the disease, =
but you are killing it too fast=E2=80=94the point is go slow enough so as n=
ot to make yourself unnecessarily uncomfortable.

If you do not have Coronavirus, but you think you have been exposed, you mi=
ght want to take two 6-drop doses of MMS, an hour apart. I would then sugge=
st doing the Starting Procedure, followed by Protocol 1000, as a preventati=
ve measure and as an overall detoxification of your body.

Again, as I have said before - an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of c=
ure. For all those wishing to stock up on their MMS products then please do=

ere I can...
